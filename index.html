         <h1>About Me</h1><br>

          <p>
            Hello World, my name is Ryan Love and I am a software developer. I am currently working as a volunteer web programmer for MonohanaRanch and I have an Associate Degree in Information Technology with a 
            Strong leaning in Software Development. My future goals is to turn my passion for software development into a paid profession so I can help out my family and become economically independent.
            Before I was working for MonohanRanch, I tried my hand at Mobile development. I have created a program to help me remember friends and families birthdays. The application was never released offically on the google 
            store, but I have put the code on my github at <a href="https://github.com/BraveHeart64/HappyReps">BraveHeart64.com!</a> Other Software Development things I am interested in is 2D game Development and Desktop Develoment.
            My favorite operating system is GNU/Linux Ubuntu Mate and I love doing things in the terminal. I know how to compile software from source code.
            As of now, I am plaining on building my own brand to sell custom software such as games and other useful things like mobile apps. For now, I have marketable skills in PHP , MYSQL, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3 and BootStrap4. Outside of programming computers and websites, I love to watch Japanese Cartoons and old school American Cartoons.

          <p>
            I have been thinking for a while that the best way to make money is to make passive income. I am planing to create computer games and mobile apps in the future to strive to provide cool applications and 
            games to help better myself. On Janurary 20019 I have tried to get into UTDallas, but unforuntally finicial aid could not award me enough money to attend so I have decided to use my skills 
            in software development to gain exprience and make money at the same time. I believe the best way to make money would be to make mobile apps and Desktop computer games.However to stay marketable,
            I decided to build this website from scracth that will ultimentally included a Ecommerence on my very own website. In the mean time, I will look for a part time job as well.Life can be hard at times
            but the one thing I have learned over my life time is that you cannont give up no matter what. I aspire to be somewhat Like John Somas, a true bull dog when it comes to life. I do not have time to feel sorry
            for myself or to blaim others because the only way things will change is if I start working as hard as possible to make things happen. On May 8 , 2019, I have not been assigned any work so I decided to make my
            own site to keep on praticing on the knowelege I have in software. By the end of three months, this website will have a backend using PHP capable of storing customers or subscribes to the website. The Store 
            part of this site will be called AmoreSoftware because I love developing software. Their is nothing more extraordinary then creating something out of nothing. Computers have given anybody the ability to create a product 
            and sell it on the market if they have the drive and the passion to make a quality product.
